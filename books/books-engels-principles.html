        <h2>Principles of Communism</h2>
        <p>
            this book is a great starter, as it clearly outlines (as the name suggests) the fundamental basics of marxist and communist theory, aswell as how marxists stand
            towards and view concepts such as religion and nationality. basic historical materialism is shown (for example in question 4) and easily understandable. the basic
            demands towards the state (minimum programme) that engels and marx had are laid out clearly, which i think should make the basic demands any marxist should have
            towards the state very clear. lastly, i personally really like the way engels writes, it is (imo) very clear and consise.
        </p>
        <p>
            all in all a very good book for any beginner marxist, very much recommend reading
