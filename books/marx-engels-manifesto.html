        <h2>The Communist Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
            this book is great, as long as you understand the context in which it was written. marx and engels tried to rouse the proletariat to action during
            the 1848 revolutions, and this book was their pamphlet. it has the base demands, the same which you see in engels' principles of communism, that are
            a great outline on the demands of the communists. it explains the position the proletariat has to the bourgeoisie and the position the communists have
            towards the proletariat. it also explains the other types of socialists (e.g. reactionary socialists) and the communists' position towards them, aswell
            as the communists' position towards the other political parties in europe at the time. this last chapter is less relevant nowadays since these parties
            don't exist anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
            the communist manifesto is a great text, albeit a bit stuck in its time. most chapters are still relevant, but, for example, some descriptions of the
            different types of socialism aswell as the position of the communists towards other parties aren't. still a great book and i definitely recommend you
            read it
